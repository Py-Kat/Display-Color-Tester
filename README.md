# | Display Color Tester!
'Display Color Tester' is a
very simple program written in
Python, which will allow the
user to choose a color
to display in it's own
resizable window!

## | General Purpose of Creation:
This tool aims to provide
the user a simple way
of troubleshooting possible display issues.
Or even simply checking how
colors look on a display!

This ability to quickly display
a chosen color on my
own monitors has personally helped
me troubleshoot and identify display
issues quite a few times,
as well as helped with
other display and color concerns.
This program's aim is to
hopefully provide that same helpful
experience to others!

### | A Few Use Cases:
- Using a plain white screen
to identify dust or dirt
on a display for easier
cleaning!

- Using a plain black screen
to identify and correct how
darker shades look on a
display!

- Using an RGB color to
identify dead pixels, or dead
sub-pixels in a display!

- Using a custom color to
preview how that color will
look on a display!

## | Previews:
The UI of this program
is very simple, utilizing the
native Python library, [***"tkinter"***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter)!

means meant to improve upon,
or be better than other
programs that hold the same
purpose or otherwise, provide the
same function! It is simply
a small project I've decided
to create and maintain for
fun! There are many alternatives
which do not require a
download, and are likely more
feature rich. Such as web
based options!
